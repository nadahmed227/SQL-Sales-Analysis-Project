# 📊 SQL Sales Analysis Project

## 🔹 Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze **sales data** using SQL.  
I built a simulated sales database with Customers, Products, Orders, and OrderDetails tables, and created queries to answer key business questions.

## 📂 Database Schema
The database includes the following tables:
- **Customers**: Customer information (ID, Name, Signup Date)
- **Products**: Product catalog with prices
- **Orders**: Customer orders with dates
- **OrderDetails**: Line items per order (Product, Quantity, Price)



## 🔑 Key Business Questions Answered
1. 💰 Total Revenue  
2. 🏆 Top 5 Best-Selling Products  
3. 👥 New Customers per Month  
4. 💵 Average Order Value  
5. 📈 Monthly Sales Trend
